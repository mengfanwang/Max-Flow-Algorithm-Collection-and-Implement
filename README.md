## Introduction
This is an open-source repository used for implementing different max-flow algorithms, especially for large-scale data problems. This repository contains two parts. One part is the dataset used for validating max-flow algorithms, which categorizes graphs by different properties. The max-flow and min-cut results of all graphs are obtained from `maxflow` function in Matlab with the Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithm. It also contains several programs used for generate dataset or validate algorithms. The other part is algorithms implemented. All algorithms should have the same input and output method. That is, all algorithms are same if regarded as blackboxes except the running time. The results of approximate algorithms may slightly different. All algorithms are coded by Matlab so that anyone can modify and make their contribution but should obey these rules.
